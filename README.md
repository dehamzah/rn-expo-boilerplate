This project is my boilerplate for developing React Native using Expo, generated with `create-react-native-app`.
Configured with eslint, prettier, and flow with VS Code as the code editor.

I am using [this guide](https://hackernoon.com/configure-eslint-prettier-and-flow-in-vs-code-for-react-development-c9d95db07213) to setup this boilerplate, and has added some additional changes to fit in Expo.
